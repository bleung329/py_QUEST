# Sun Vector Approximation using Antenna Photodiodes

## Usage

## Why did I make this?
The [MiTEE](http://clasp-research.engin.umich.edu/groups/s3fl/mitee/home/) 1 mission has launched. Unfortunately, we are unable to receive the sun vector data from the photodiode pyramids (as of Feb 3 2021). Our magnetometer is able to output an magnetic field vector but since 2 vectors are needed to resolve an attitude, we will need to find a second vector. We've decided to use the photodiodes for detecting antenna deployment to roughly estimate a sun vector. While likely high in error, it will be better than no attitude information at all.
